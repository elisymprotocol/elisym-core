//! Payment provider abstraction for multi-chain support.
//!
//! This module defines the [`PaymentProvider`] trait — the core payment interface
//! that all payment backends implement. The trait is always compiled (no feature gate),
//! while concrete implementations are feature-gated.
//!
//! Current implementations:
//! - [`ldk::LdkPaymentProvider`] — Lightning Network via LDK-node (feature: `payments-ldk`)
//! - [`solana::SolanaPaymentProvider`] — Solana (native SOL) (feature: `payments-solana`)
